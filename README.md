# Emporium Library

This repository contains the Solver mechanisms of Emporium to create, execute, and validate the state of parallel intent declarations and transactions. This is the fastest way to get up and running with the functionality of an intent-based architecture.

Built using:

-   `Typescript` - You will find types for each piece to make working with the library simple.
-   Hardhat - Powering the chain-based tests, Hardhat ensures the library always functions.
-   Ethers - Provides the peripheral functionality needed to work with onchain Ethereum accounts.

To install this library in your repository for personal use run:

```
pnpm i @nftchance/emporium-lib
```

To run the tests you can simple run:

```shell
npx hardhat test
```
