# Emporium Library

Emporium is the fastest way to get up and running with the a typesafe intent-based architecture in Typescript. Here you can find Solver and Signer mechanisms of Emporium to create, execute, and validate the state of parallel intent declarations and transactions. 

Without `Emporium`:

- ðŸš¨ `.signTypedData()` returns a raw hex `type:string`.
- ðŸ¤” `type:string` has none of the logical utilities of an `class:Intent`.
- ðŸ¤¬ `.recover()` requires you manage signature parts and backend support.

With `Emporium`:

- ðŸ§© `.sign()` returns a typesafe version of a `class:Intent`.
- ðŸ¥¹ `class:Intent` includes all the utilities of a typical intent protocol.
- âœ… `.recover()` automaticaly verify the `Signer` from in-memory cache.
- ðŸš€ and several more small helper utilities. 

Built using:

```ml
â”œâ”€ abitype - "Parse EIP712 types to typesafe structs."
â”œâ”€ ethers - "Provides the peripheral functionality needed to work with onchain Ethereum accounts."
â”œâ”€ hardhat - "Powering the chain-based tests, Hardhat ensures the library always functions."
â””â”€ typescript - "You will find types for each piece to make working with the library simple."
```
