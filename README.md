# Emporium Library

Emporium is the fastest way to get up and running with the an intent-based architecture. Here you can find Solver and Signer mechanisms of Emporium to create, execute, and validate the state of parallel intent declarations and transactions. 

❄️ Without Emporium

- Handle [EIP-712](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-712) types to build your intent backend.
- Pass around raw strings without the needed utilities.
- Integrate the verification mechanisms into your protocol.

🔥 With Emporium

- Integrate with the onchain framework in just a few lines.
- Complete type-compliance of EIP-712 types thanks to [abitype](https://abitype.dev/).
- Built-in utilities to make your life easier.
